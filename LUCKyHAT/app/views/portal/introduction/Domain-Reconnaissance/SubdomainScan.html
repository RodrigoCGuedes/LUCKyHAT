<p>Subdomain scanning is an essential process in OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) and security assessments, aiming to identify subdomains related to a target domain. Subdomains often host distinct services or systems, which can sometimes expose vulnerabilities or overlooked entry points.</p>

<p>The primary objectives of Subdomain Scanning include:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Discovering Subdomains:</strong> Enumerating subdomains linked to the main domain to identify additional services or assets that may be part of the target infrastructure.</li>
    <li><strong>Understanding the Infrastructure:</strong> Mapping subdomains to understand the organization’s online footprint, which can reveal critical insights into its digital presence.</li>
    <li><strong>Detecting Vulnerabilities:</strong> Subdomains may expose services or systems that are less secure, making them potential targets for exploitation.</li>
</ul>

<p>Effective subdomain scanning allows security teams to map out the complete attack surface, identify potential weaknesses, and act proactively to mitigate risks. Subdomains often provide unique insights into a company's infrastructure that may not be visible through the main domain alone.</p>

<p>Our tool automates the subdomain scanning process, providing comprehensive and accurate results. The data is presented clearly, making it easy to identify important subdomains and potential security concerns.</p>
