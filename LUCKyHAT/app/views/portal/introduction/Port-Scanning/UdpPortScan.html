<p>UDP Port Scan is an essential tool in OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) and network security assessments, focusing on identifying open UDP ports on a target system. As UDP-based services are often less monitored than TCP, this tool provides critical insights into potential entry points and vulnerabilities.</p>

<p>The primary objectives of UdpPortScan include:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Service Discovery:</strong> Detecting services that communicate over the UDP protocol, which is commonly used for DNS, SNMP, and other essential network services.</li>
    <li><strong>Vulnerability Detection:</strong> Identifying potential security risks associated with open UDP ports, which are often targeted due to their stateless nature and lack of connection validation.</li>
    <li><strong>Network Mapping:</strong> Understanding the role of UDP services within the broader network infrastructure and assessing their impact on overall security.</li>
    <li><strong>Incident Response:</strong> Monitoring changes in open UDP ports can provide insights into unauthorized access or misconfigurations that may arise.</li>
</ul>

<p>Effective use of the UdpPortScan tool can enhance your security posture by revealing critical information about a target's network configuration. This data is vital for penetration testing, incident response, and ongoing security monitoring.</p>

<p>Our UdpPortScan tool simplifies the process of scanning for open UDP ports, offering fast and detailed results to support your OSINT activities. The results are presented in a clear format, making it easy to analyze and utilize the information gathered.</p>
