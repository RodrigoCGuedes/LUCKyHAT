<p>Port Scanning is a fundamental technique in network security assessments, used to identify open ports and the
    services running on them within a target system. This process is a key step in the OSINT (Open Source Intelligence)
    and penetration testing phases, allowing analysts to map the attack surface of a network.</p>

<p>The main objectives of Port Scanning include:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Identifying Open Ports:</strong> Detecting which ports on a target system are open and accessible. Open
        ports can represent potential entry points for attackers if they are running vulnerable services.</li>
    <li><strong>Service Detection:</strong> Determining the type of service and its version running on the open ports.
        This information is crucial for identifying known vulnerabilities associated with specific services.</li>
    <li><strong>Network Topology Mapping:</strong> Understanding the layout and configuration of the network by
        analyzing the ports and services exposed to the internet or within an internal network.</li>
    <li><strong>Assessing Security Posture:</strong> Evaluating the security measures in place by identifying potential
        weaknesses, such as unnecessary open ports or outdated services that could be exploited.</li>
</ul>

<p>Port Scanning is essential for discovering vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers. By identifying open
    ports and the services behind them, security professionals can assess the risk level and take necessary actions to
    secure the network.</p>

<p>Our tool automates the process of Port Scanning, providing comprehensive results that include detailed information
    about open ports, running services, and potential vulnerabilities. These insights are crucial for proactive network
    defense and enhancing the overall security posture.</p>
