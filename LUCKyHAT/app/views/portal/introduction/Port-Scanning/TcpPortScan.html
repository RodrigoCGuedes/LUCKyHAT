<p>TCP Port Scan is a crucial tool in OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) and network security assessments. It allows users to identify open TCP ports on a target system, providing insights into the services and applications that are accessible over the network.</p>

<p>The primary objectives of TcpPortScan include:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Service Discovery:</strong> Identifying which services are running on a target host by scanning for open TCP ports, enabling a better understanding of the system's configuration.</li>
    <li><strong>Vulnerability Assessment:</strong> Detecting potential vulnerabilities associated with exposed services, which can be critical for security evaluations.</li>
    <li><strong>Network Mapping:</strong> Mapping the network structure by analyzing the open ports and associated services across multiple hosts.</li>
    <li><strong>Monitoring Changes:</strong> Keeping track of changes in the state of open ports, which can indicate new services being introduced or potential security risks.</li>
</ul>

<p>Effective use of the TcpPortScan tool can enhance your security posture by providing vital information about a target's network configuration. This data is essential for penetration testing, incident response, and ongoing security monitoring.</p>

<p>Our TcpPortScan tool simplifies the process of scanning for open TCP ports, offering fast and detailed results to support your OSINT activities. The results are displayed in a clear format, making it easy to analyze and utilize the information gathered.</p>
