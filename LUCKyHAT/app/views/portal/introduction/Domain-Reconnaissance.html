<p>Domain Reconnaissance is a critical phase in the OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) process, where the goal is to
    gather as much information as possible about a target domain. This stage typically involves the identification of
    subdomains, IP addresses, DNS records, and other relevant data associated with the domain.</p>

<p>The primary objectives of Domain Reconnaissance include:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Subdomain Enumeration:</strong> Discovering subdomains that belong to the main domain, which could
        reveal additional services or entry points.</li>
    <li><strong>IP Address Mapping:</strong> Identifying the IP addresses linked to the domain and its subdomains,
        aiding in the understanding of the network infrastructure.</li>
    <li><strong>DNS Record Analysis:</strong> Extracting DNS records, such as A, MX, TXT, and CNAME, to understand how
        the domain's traffic is routed and what services are associated with it.</li>
    <li><strong>Gathering Metadata:</strong> Collecting metadata from various sources, including WHOIS data, to identify
        the domain's owner, registration details, and other potentially sensitive information.</li>
</ul>

<p>Effective Domain Reconnaissance can uncover vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and other weaknesses that could be
    exploited in further stages of a security assessment or penetration test. This information is essential for building
    a comprehensive understanding of the target's digital footprint.</p>

<p>Our tool provides automated capabilities for Domain Reconnaissance, allowing for efficient and thorough data
    collection. The results are presented in a user-friendly format, enabling users to quickly identify critical
    insights and take appropriate action.</p>
